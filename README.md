> FactFlip is an image macro meme generator designed for creating fact-checking memes based on misinforming claims and their corrections.


## üìê Archtecture
FactFlip, like [MemeCraft](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14652), uses a large language model to understand and generate memes. However, FactFlip focuses on creating specific memes to debunk misinformation, using humor and well-matched meme formats to make the corrections clear and engaging.
